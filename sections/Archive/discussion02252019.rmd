To summarize, Proposition `r astar` states that if regime change occurs, vanquished governments will be replaced by low bias types, in order to maximize market access for firms in the victorious country. Proposition `r Pgamma` states that this causes larger conflicts of interest between high bias governments. Because of these larger conflicts of interest, high bias governments are also likely to fight wars more often (Proposition `r Pwar`). In the end, low bias pairs trade more than high bias pairs, because of their underlying more liberal trade policy preferences (Proposition `r PeqTrade`).

The observation that protectionism and foreign policy hostility are correlated is as old as @Gerschenkron1943. In implementing high tariffs, high bias governments cut into the profits of firms abroad, whose welfare becomes more important as the foreign government becomes more biased. This behavior both increases the returns to being able to replace foreign governments with puppets with more dovish preferences, and increases the costs of being forced to adopt the policies of a foreign-installed puppet. These counterfactual scenarios determine the magnitude of the conflict of interest governments face when interacting with one another, and the likelihood that governments will be unable to find a peaceful resolution to their conflict of interest.

The positive correlations between trade, democracy, and war propensity are the central features of the modern economic peace. While the model developed here predicts that trade and peace will be positively correlated, trade *policy* remains the object of contention between governments. Protectionist barriers cause conflicts of interest between market access-motivated governments. Consistent with this argument, @Mcdonald2004 shows that measures of *protection* are better predictors of international conflict than simple trade flows, which might remain large even in the presence of large trade barriers.^[His analysis covers the years 1960-2000.] World War I broke out during an era of rapid globalization, but @Mcdonald2007 show that the great powers maintained high protective tariffs during this era, providing a rationale for conflict over market access conditions. @Chatagnier2015 show that governments whose firms compete in the same export markets are more likely to experience international conflicts, consistent with a (yet unwritten) multi-sector version of this model. Examining a host of major conflicts in the 19th and 20th centuries, @Copeland2014 concludes that governments are more likely to fight when they have a dim view of future *trade expectations*. Of course, these trade expectations are influenced by governments' expectations of what trade policies will be adopted by governments with which they interact. Governments' bias types, a domestic political primitive dismissed by Copeland, are thus at the root of both trade expectations and conflict propensity.

While regime type (bias) influences governments' policy preferences, military power determines which government is able to maintain policies closer to its ideal. Powerful countries (high $\rho$) adopt home tariffs close to their ideal, while coercing market access out of their militarily weaker trading partner. In this sense, military power and political bias interact to determine trade policy outcomes. Governments' trade policies reflect their underlying policy preferences, up to a regime change constraint from abroad. The government's constrained choice balances domestic interests against military threats from abroad. Empirically, this suggests that militarily powerful countries should receive better market access conditions, all else equal, than their weaker counterparts.

The source of foreign policy belligerence in the model is the protectionist preferences of home firms, and the governments that internalize these preferences. @Fordham2019 traces the development of the United States as a naval power, starting in the late 19th century. He finds that protectionist economic interests were the strongest advocates for the nascent U.S. fleet. At the time, the United States pursued a policy of protectionism at home, and sought preferential market access in developing countries, particularly in Latin America. The fleet served to protect these objectives against military interference from Europe. At the dawn of the Cold War, Congressmen representing districts with export-oriented firms tended to also support the burgeoning U.S. alliance network and an aggressive military posture toward the Soviet Union [@Fordham1998]. The goal of these firms, argues Fordham, was to secure market access and a stable investment climate in Europe and Japan and protect these markets from Soviet control. While these actions were often justified in terms of ensuring U.S. security, underlying economic interests shaped what is deemed a security threat in the first place [@Fordham2008]. In the post-Cold War era, Congressmen representing import-exposed districts have tended to support hostile foreign policies toward China, whose exports (plausibly) harm their constituent firms [@Kleinberg2013]. While their opaque nature makes it difficult to assess the influence of economic interests on security policy, authoritarian regimes arguably better internalize the trade policy interests of firm owners than their democratic counterparts, due to the more limited influence of consumers on the policymaking process.^[See @Branstetter2002 for evidence on the trade policy objectives of the Communist Party of China.]

@Lake2019 argues that the degree of military competition in U.S.-China relations in the 21st century will depend on the extent to which protectionist interests in both countries come to dominate the policymaking process. If China liberalizes its political system, and the United States rejects resurgent protectionist pressures, the governments will experience less conflict. By contrast, if China remains authoritarian, its growing firms will more readily seek protection at home and preferential market access abroad, bringing the Chinese Communist Party into conflict with the United States government.
