The model envisions a stylized world -- two governments preside over identical economies with military capacity and political bias types given exogenously. If the countries were heterogeneous in market size ($L_i$), the economically larger country would be conferred with an additional source of bargaining power. Whether or not this outside option "binds" in determining bargaining outcomes would depend on the relative distribution of economic and military might. Military power ($\rho$) is also treated exogenously here, but certainly would depend on economic and political primitives in any model that allowed for military investment. Because they have more at stake in international trade policy negotiations, high bias governments would be expected to invest more in their militaries, particularly if the costs of militarization are borne by consumers [@Jackson2007; @Chapman2015]. This might explain why democracies spend less on their militaries than autocracies [@Fordham2005]. In an $N$-government world, alliances would be easier to sustain between low bias governments, because these governments would experience small conflicts of interest with one another. Pooled military power could therefore be freed up to mitigate the autarkic impulses of higher bias governments. Finally, in any dynamic variant of the model presented here, regime type itself would be an endogenous object. Wars would always result in the imposition of puppet governments more welfare-concious than the vanquished governments that preceded them. This would create a natural trend toward democratization, emanating from the preferences of imperial powers [@Mcdonald2015].^[The history of imperialism suggests that conquering governments often find it easier to install highly autocratic puppets that nevertheless protect the interests of the patron government. Viewed from the lens of this theoretical framework, this behavior would stem from a desire to protect preferential access to conquered markets, a favoritist trade policy that would not be preferred by a low bias puppet.]

The model has implications for empirical international political economy scholars studying the relationship between democracy and trade liberalization. Several studies have employed the Grossman-Helpman model to structurally estimate governments' welfare-consciousness cross-nationally [@Goldberg1999; @Mitra2006; @Gawande2009; @Gawande2012; @Gawande2015]. All use as estimating equations the predicted equilibrium protection of a small country taking an international price as given [@Grossman1994] or a large country engaged in efficient 'trade talks' [@Grossman1995]. If governments set trade policy under the shadow of militarized coercion, these estimates will be biased. This estimation procedure rationalizes low levels of protection by infering that governments must place a relatively high weight on the welfare of their consumers. In this model, governments can adopt low levels of protection either because they are not rent seekers *or* because they face a credible threat of force from a trading partner that seeks market access. High bias governments whose markets are pried open by threats of force adopt the same trade policies as low bias governments which adopt such policies because they benefit consumers.

My conclusions about the theoretical basis for the empirical behavior of democratic dyads depends crucially on the mapping between low bias types in the model and real world democracies. While canonical models of trade policy formation reserve a central role for voters as a check on the protectionist impulses of firms [@Mayer1984; @Grossman1994], more recent work has cast doubts on the veracity of this assumption [@Guisinger2009; @Betz2019]. Perhaps democracies simply allow a wider variety of firms to access the political process, who in turn lobby to reduce barriers on intermediate inputs [@Kim2017]. By some measures, democracies do implement lower barriers to trade than their autocratic counterparts [@Milner2005; @Gawande2009], but this model suggests that this simple revealed preference approach to characterizing preferences is insufficient in a world in which militarized bargaining occurs. The model can only rationalize the "democratic" component of the modern economic peace if democracies indeed hold more liberal trade policy preferences than autocracies. Without this preference distribution, the modern economic peace remains an enigma from the perspective of this model.

Finally, the theory highlights a prerequisite for international conflict that is underappreciated in the existing literature. For governments to initiate war with one another, they must both 1) possess conflicts of interest large enough to justify the costs of conflict and 2) be unable to resolve these conflicts peacefully. Theoretical research on international conflict has focused principally on identifying conditions under which 2) does not obtain. But understanding the emergence of conflicts of interest is arguably as or more important than understanding bargaining failures for identifying what types of governments are most likely to experience hostile international relations. Interstate war is incredibly rare in contemporary international politics, but many dyads still experience antagonistic and militarized political relations. Focusing attention on the conflicts of interest underlying these antagonisms, rather than realized conflict, might help explain their emergence and termination.
