Jointly, Propositions `r Pwar` and `r PeqTrade` establish that the most liberal governments never fight and also trade more than illiberal governments. Contra the commercial peace framework, trade is endogenously determined by governments trade policy choices. These endogenous trade policies determines trade flows and generate conflicts between governments. Economic integration is not exogenously given. Rather, participation in the international economy is a choice. Even in today's globalized era, such policy frictions persist [@Anderson2004, @Cooley2019b].

These policy choices are the object of contention between governments in the model. Protectionist barriers cause conflicts of interest between market access-motivated governments. @Mcdonald2004 shows that measures of protection are better predictors of conflict than trade.^[His analysis covers the years 1960-2000.] Trade can persist in the presence of trade barriers. For example, World War I broke out during an era of rapid globalization. @Mcdonald2007 show that the great powers maintained high protective tariffs during this era, which provided a rationale for conflict over market access conditions, despite high trade volumes. @Chatagnier2015 examine governments whose firms compete in the same export markets. They show these governments are more likely to experience international conflicts.

Firms are the source of belligerent foreign policies in the theory. In Imperial Germany, "iron and rye" advocated for protectionism and expansionist foreign policies [@Gerschenkron1943]. Similar domestic political coalitions emerged in the United States. @Fordham2019 traces the development of the United States as a naval power in the 19th century. He finds protectionist interests were the strongest advocates for the nascent U.S. fleet. At the time, U.S. trade policy was protectionist. Washington also sought preferential market access in developing countries, particularly in Latin America. The fleet served to protect these objectives against military interference from Europe. Commercial objectives also motivated Washington at the dawn of the Cold War [@Fordham1998]. Under Soviet influence, Eastern Europe became closed to trade with the United States. Congressmen representing export-oriented districts tended to support an aggressive military posture toward the Soviet Union. The goal of export-oriented firms, argues Fordham, was to secure market access in Europe and Japan. In the post-Cold War era, Congressmen representing import-exposed districts have tended to support hostile foreign policies toward China, whose exports (plausibly) harm their constituent firms [@Kleinberg2013]. 

Domestic political institutions connect these underlying economic interests to government preferences. I treat these institutions in reduced form, focusing on variation in consumers' ability to influence policy. Consumers pacify foreign policy preferences. If democratic political institutions privilege the interests of consumers, then Propositions `r Pwar` and `r PeqTrade` support a commercial-democratic peace. Observational analyses uncover positive correlations between democracy, trade, and peace because of the trade policy preferences of democracies.^[See @Oneal1999 for a representative study.] Liberal preferences increase trade and reduce conflict.

Observed trade policies are not a sufficient statistic for government preferences, however. Proposition `r PeqTau` states that relative military power effects trade policy in peacetime. Governments' trade policies reflect their preferences only up to a war constraint. Liberal *policies* do not imply liberal *preferences*. Several studies have employed @Grossman1994 and @Grossman1995 to structurally estimate governments' welfare-consciousness [@Goldberg1999; @Mitra2006; @Gawande2009; @Gawande2012; @Ossa2014; @Gawande2015]. International strategic considerations are effectively absent from these models. The domestic political economy determines outcomes. Therefore, a simple inversion on the policy function recovers preferences. The model developed here highlights the importance of the war constraint. Militarily weak, illiberal governments adopt the same policies as liberal governments.

Territory plays a central role in theories and empirical studies of interstate conflict.^[The "pie" at stake in bargaining models of war is often motivated as the distribution of territory between the countries. Empirical studies of territorial conflict often conceptualize territorial control as a consumption good, rather than a means to implement policy. See, for example, @Caselli2015. For a review of this literature, see @Schultz2015.] Wars often redraw international borders. In doing so, they also relocate customs barriers and modify the trade policies of captured regions. Gunboat diplomacy and territorial conflict are plausibly substitutes for one another. Governments can acquire foreign market access through territorial annexation or regime change. Territory and trade policy are not exclusive realms of international conflict.
