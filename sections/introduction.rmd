Countries with deep trading relationships rarely fight wars with one another. Some argue this "commercial peace" is due to the pacifying effect of trade — trade causes peace.^[This literature is vast. See @Gartzke2015 for a complete survey. @Angell1911, @Polachek1980, and @Philippe2008 are representative of this view.] Others say amicable political relations cause trade.^[See, for example, @Pollins1989a, @Barbieri1999, @Benson2007] Trade is usually considered to be exogenous to conflicts of interest in international relations. Governments are posited to fight wars over territorial, ideological, or other non-economic conflicts of interest. Preexisting trade relations make these conflicts more costly, and less likely as a result.

Yet, trade policy is itself a central object of contention in international relations. Governments are mercantilist to some extent [@Gawande2009]. They desire some degree of protection at home and "open doors" abroad and have historically been willing to fight wars to compel market openness abroad.^[See @Findlay2007 for a chronicle of trade conflicts over the past millennium.] In the 1850s, the U.S. gunboats compelled an autarkic Japanese government to open its markets. Britain and France prosecuted the Opium Wars (1839-1842; 1856-1860) to compel a recalcitrant Chinese government to reform its trade policies. Recently, a proposal to integrate the economies of Ukraine and the European Union led to war between Ukraine and Russia.^[In this case, Moscow conditioned its coercion on the trade policy choices of Kiev, see James Marson and Naftali Bendavid, ["Ukraine to Delay Part of EU Pact Opposed by Russia,"](https://www.wsj.com/articles/poroshenko-says-eu-agreement-to-be-ratified-next-week-1410519009) *The Wall Street Journal*, 12 September 2014.] These episodes highlight linkages between trade policy and war. But such linkages may be more common, as the absence of war need not imply the absence of coercive bargaining [@Fearon1995].

Here, I develop a theory of trade policy bargaining in the shadow of military power, or "gunboat diplomacy." The value of international trade flows and the probability of peace are positively correlated in equilibrium. This correlation emerges not because trade causes peace. Rather, liberal trade policy preferences generate incentives for both trade and peace. When peace prevails, latent military threats influence equilibrium trade policies, which balance domestic political-economic interests against military threats from abroad. Militarily weak countries are more open to trade than powerful ones, all else equal.

The model considers the interaction between two governments (home and foreign), which each value a weighted average of consumer welfare and firm profits. These components of government utility themselves depend on the workings of an underlying "new trade" international economy [@Krugman1980; @Venables1987]. Governments differ in how much influence consumers have over policymaking.^[This setup mirrors @Grossman1994.] I refer to this variation as the governments' degree of political *bias*.^[This phraseology borrows from @Jackson2007. In their model, political bias determines the extent to which the pivotal decision maker internalizes the costs of war. Conceptually, bias is similar to the size of the selectorate in the model of @BuenodeMesquita2003.] Tariffs help firms by shielding them from competition, but raise prices for consumers. *Low bias* or *liberal* governments prefer lower tariffs.

Governments care about trade policy choices abroad because of market access externalities [@Ossa2011; @Ossa2012]. Firms' profits depend on their ability to access foreign markets. High tariffs shift profits from foreign to home firms. Therefore, firms on opposite sides of a border experience a conflict of interest over trade policy. Firms desire protection at home and liberalization abroad. The greater their bias, the more the governments internalize these interests.

As a consequence, governments themselves experience conflicts of interest over trade policy, which vary as a function of the governments' bias. When governments value consumer welfare, they prefer to adopt low barriers to trade. In doing so, they impose small market access externalities on their trading partners. When both governments hold liberal policy preferences, their relations are harmonious -- there is no incentive for conflict, militarized or otherwise. As governments become less liberal, conflicts of interest become more severe.

If a government wins a war, it earns the right to impose regime change and install a "puppet" government abroad.^[See @Owen2002 for an empirical study of regime change.] Puppets open their markets to foreign firms, allowing victorious governments impose their trade policy preferences by force. This is the threat point governments leverage in bilateral trade policy negotiations. War sometimes occurs due to information frictions.

Two primary insights emerge from this environment. First, governments' degree of bias affects their propensity to trade and fight wars. When both governments are liberal, the costs of regime change never exceed its policy benefits. As a result, highly liberal governments never fight wars with one another. Their liberal preferences also result in liberal equilibrium trade policies. Naturally, lowering barriers to trade increases trade itself. The governments' preference compatibility produces a relationship between trade and peace, but this relationship is spurious — trade itself has no pacifying effect. Second, even when governments avoid conflict, trade policies reflect the balance of military power between the governments. Powerful countries can credibly threaten to impose regime change. They leverage this power to extract trade policy concessions and resist liberalization. After bargaining, powerful countries are more protectionist than weaker ones.

The model rationalizes several well-established empirical facts in international relations. Bilateral trade tends to decrease before wars and rebound thereafter.^[This relationship is shown in Figure \ref{fig:tradeRD} in the Appendix.] In the model, protectionist preference shocks decrease trade, but also increase the likelihood of war. As a consequence, periods of depressed trade correlate with war onset. Conversely, regime change following war causes a liberal preference shock to the losing country's government. Trade increases after wars, as in the data.

Some argue democracies have more liberal trade policy preferences than autocracies [@Milner2005]. Because consumers (voters) prefer free trade, they punish protectionist politicians [@Mayer1984; @Grossman1996].^[For a skeptical take on this mechanism, see @Guisinger2009 and @Betz2019.] This provides a check on the protectionist influence of special interest groups. Translated into this framework, these theories deem democracies less biased than autocracies. If this "liberal democracy" hypothesis holds, the analysis of low bias governments extends to democratic dyads. The model then jointly rationalizes the democratic peace and democracies' propensity for trade openness.^[These facts are depicted in Figure \ref{fig:comdempeace} in the Appendix. For a recent review on the relationship between democracy and peace, see @Reiter2017. @Milner2005 show democratization tends to lead to decreased protectionism.]

The theory's implications about power and protectionism are, as far as I know, novel. I consider these empirical implications in more detail in the Discussion section. There, I also relate the theory to militarism, imperialism, and territorial conflict.

@Antras2011 and @Carroll2018 are two closely related papers that merit some discussion. @Antras2011 consider a similar model, in which foreign governments can interfere in the domestic political economy of trade. As in this model, foreign influence has a liberalizing effect. In the anarchy of world politics, however such influence can always -– in principle -– take the form of threats, displays, or uses of military force [@Fearon1997]. Analyzing this form of influence allows me to relate the domestic political economy of trade to military power and conflict propensity. @Carroll2018 unifies militarized competition and economic exchange in a more general setting. There, countries' convert commodities into military power, which can in turn be employed to seize others' commodities. Military power itself is endogenous to the general equilibrium of the international economy. I take power as exogenous and focus on competition over trade *policy*. This more narrow focus allows me to incorporate domestic political economy considerations and make empirical predictions about power, trade policy, and war.

Others have considered policy competition in the shadow of power more generally. @Bils2017 study a model of coercive bargaining over the location of a spatial policy. Like the model studied here, governments vary in the location of their ideal points. They study how uncertainty over the states' ideal points affects conflict propensity. Here, I microfound governments' preferences with a political economy of trade policy and explore how domestic political economic shocks affect the international bargaining environment. This generates unique comparative statics and empirical implications.
