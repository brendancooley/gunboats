The model envisions a stylized world. Two governments preside over identical economies exogenous military capacities and political bias types. If the countries were heterogeneous in market size ($L_i$), the economically larger country would possess an additional source of bargaining power. Whether this outside option affects bargaining outcomes would depend on the distribution of economic and military strength. This analysis might shed light the substitutability of economic and military coercion [@Hirschman1945].

Military power ($\rho$) is also treated as exogenous here. If military investment was possible, $\rho$ would depend on economic and political primitives.^[See, for example, @Jackson2009.] Because they have more at stake in bargaining, illiberal governments might invest more in their militaries. This results would hold especially if the costs of militarization are borne by consumers [@Jackson2007; @Chapman2015]. This variant might explain why democracies spend less on their militaries [@Fordham2005].

If the game developed here was dynamic, regime type itself would be an endogenous object. Wars impose puppet governments more liberal than those that preceded them. The world would democratize over time, as conquering powers installed liberal governments abroad. [@Mcdonald2015].

While imperial powers sometimes seek to democratize defeated countries, they often instead install allied strongmen or colonial administrations. If the liberal democracy hypothesis holds, these actions are puzzling. Controlling these governments presents agency problem absent in relations with liberal regimes. Liberal regimes adopt liberal trade policies of their own accord. Conquerers must incentivize their agents to adopt these policies.

A multi-country variant of this framework might provide a rationale for this behavior. Consider a world populated with three countries â€” A, B, and C. For firms in A, an ideal policy for B is one that is open to trade with A but closed to trade from C. This allows A's firms to maximize their share of B's market.^[This assumes, of course, that B cannot tax its own firms.] In other words, firms seek *preferential* access to foreign markets. It is immediate that a low bias government would not provide such preferential access. Coercing governments might be willing to suffer the agency costs of obtaining preferential access to B if B's market was valuable enough. This framework might be profitably applied to the study of imperialism [@Gallagher1953].

Finally, the theory highlights an underappreciated prerequisite for international conflict. For governments to war with one another, they must both 1) possess conflicts of interest large enough to justify the costs of conflict and 2) be unable to resolve these conflicts peacefully [@Jackson2009b]. Theoretical research on international conflict has focused on the latter. In abstracting away from the exact nature of the dispute at hand, these models direct our attention away from the question of why international disputes emerge in the first place. What do governments want, and why do their objectives bring them into conflict with one another [@Moravcsik1997; @CoeND]? While war is rare in international politics, antagonistic and militarized political relations are common. Focusing attention on the conflicts of interest underlying these antagonisms might help explain their emergence and termination.
