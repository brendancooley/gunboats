By Lemma `r omegaStar`, $\tilde{\bm{\tau}} = \left\{ \tau_i^\star(a_i), 1 \right\}$ will be accepted for all cost types $c_j \in \left[ \ubar{c}_j, \bar{c}_j \right]$. Since this offer maximizes $i$'s utility conditional on peace,
$$
\tilde{\bm{\tau}}^\star = \left\{ \tau_i^\star(a_i), \tau_j^\star(\bar{a}) \right\}
$$
$\blacksquare$
