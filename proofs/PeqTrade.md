Equilibrium trade in manufactured goods is 
$$
x_{ij}^\star(\tau_i) + x_{ji}^\star(\tau_j)
$$
where both $x_{ij}^\star(\tau_i)$ and $x_{ji}^\star(\tau_j)$ are decreasing in each country's tariff rate. The bounds of the pareto set are decreasing in $a_i$, $a_j$ by Lemma `r taui`. Otherwise, the strategic situation is unchanged. Thus, $\tilde{\tau}_i^\star(a_i)$ and $\tilde{\tau}_j^\star(a_i)$ are weakly decreasing in $a_i$. Thus, equilibrium trade is also weakly increasing. $\blacksquare$
