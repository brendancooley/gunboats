Equilibrium trade in manufactured goods is 
$$
x_{ij}^\star(\tau_i) + x_{ji}^\star(\tau_j)
$$
And total trade is 
$$
x_{ij}^\star(\tau_i) + x_{ji}^\star(\tau_j) + \mid x_{ij}^\star(\tau_i) - x_{ji}^\star(\tau_j) \mid
$$
where $\mid x_{ij}^\star(\tau_i) - x_{ji}^\star(\tau_j) \mid$ is the (market clearing) value of agricultural trade. We have established that $x_{ij}^\star(\tau_i)$ and $x_{ji}^\star(\tau_j)$ are decreasing in each country's tariff rate. It therefore remains to show that $\tilde{\tau}_i^\star(a_i, a_j)$ and $\tilde{\tau}_j^\star(a_i, a_j)$ are decreasing in $a_i, a_j$. First, $\frac{\partial \tilde{\tau}_i^\star(a_i, a_j)}{\partial a_i} < 0$ because the cross partial
\begin{align*}
\frac{\partial \tilde{G}_i(\tilde{\tau}_i)}{\partial \tilde{\tau}_i} &= \left( 1 - F \left( W_j(a_j, a_i) - G_j(\cdot, \tilde{\tau}_i | a_j) \right) \right) \frac{\partial^2 G_i(\tilde{\tau}_i)}{\partial \tilde{\tau}_i^2} - \frac{1}{\bar{c}_j - \ubar{c}_j} \frac{\partial W_j(a_j, a_i)}{\partial a_i} + \frac{1}{\bar{c}_j - \ubar{c}_j} \frac{\partial G_j(\cdot, \tilde{\tau}_i | a_j)}{\partial \tau_i} \left( \frac{\partial G_i(\tilde{\tau}_i, \cdot; a_i)}{\partial \tilde{\tau}_i} - \frac{\partial \hat{G}_i(a_i, a_j)}{\partial a_i} \right) \\
&= \left( 1 - F \left( W_j(a_j, a_i) - G_j(\cdot, \tilde{\tau}_i | a_j) \right) \right) \frac{\partial^2 G_i(\tilde{\tau}_i)}{\partial \tilde{\tau}_i^2} - \frac{1}{\bar{c}_j - \ubar{c}_j} \frac{\partial W_j(a_j, a_i)}{\partial a_i} + \frac{1}{\bar{c}_j - \ubar{c}_j} \frac{\partial G_j(\cdot, \tilde{\tau}_i | a_j)}{\partial \tau_i} \left( V_i(\tilde{\tau}_i) - \left( \rho V_i(\tau_i^\star(a_i)) + (1 - \rho) V_i(\tau_i^\star(\bar{a}) \right) \right)
\end{align*}
is negative.
