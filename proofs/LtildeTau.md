Suppose, for sake of contradiction, that for some $\tilde{\bm{\tau}}^\star$, $\tilde{\tau}_i^\star > \tau_i^\star(a_i)$. By Lemma `r Lpareto`, $\tilde{\bm{\tau}}^\star$ must lie in the pareto set. By the definition of $\tau_i^\star(a_i)$, $G_i(\tilde{\tau}_i^\star, \cdot; a_i) < G_i(\tau_i^\star(a_i), \cdot; a_i)$. By Lemma `r Ltauj`, $G_j(\cdot, \tilde{\tau}_i^\star; a_j) < G_j(\cdot, \tau_i^\star(a_i); a_i)$. Thus, a pareto improvement exists, contradicting the hypothesis that $\tilde{\bm{\tau}}^\star$ is an equilibrium offer. $\blacksquare$
