We have two cases, either $a_j(\ubar{c}, a_i) = \ubar{a}$ or 
$$
a_j(\ubar{c}, a_i) = \Gamma_j^{-1}(\ubar{c}; a_i)
$$
Since $\Gamma_j(a_j, a_i)$ is decreasing in $a_i$ (Proposition `r Pgamma`), so is its inverse. This is sufficient to guarantee that $a_j(\ubar{c}_j, a_i)$ is decreasing in $a_i$. $\blacksquare$
